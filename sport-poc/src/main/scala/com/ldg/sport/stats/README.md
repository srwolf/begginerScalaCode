## There are 2 choices of Main software:
* aSynchronous choice: Main 
* synchronous choice: Main2 [This is commented, it is unnatural to block a Future. There are exceptions, for instances in Test cases, in which could be useful block or wait for a Future result.If you want latter case use Main2(unncomment it) and comment the Main Object code]
